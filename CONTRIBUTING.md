Contributing to coderunner
=========================

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented
  or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it
  and/or contributed it. If not open a new issue.
* Fork the project referencing the issue number.
* Write feature/bugfix and tests. Please adhere to the coding style guide in
  the README.
* Open a Pull Request. This will trigger an automated Travis CI build to run
  the tests.
* Once PR passes all tests and reviews it will be merged into master.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to
  have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please
  isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
