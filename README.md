CodeRunner
==========

CodeRunner is a framework for the automated running and analysis of
simulations. It automatically generates any necessary input files, organises
the output data and analyses it. Because it is a modular system, it can easily
be customised to work with any system and any simulation code.

Coding Style Guide
==================

These bullet points are taken from here: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide

* Indentation is strictly two spaces, i.e. not tabs.
* Where possible do not exceed 80 columns. This makes the code much more
  readable.
* Do not sign your initials when contributing code, this is what revision
  control is for.
* Avoid unnecessary comments or inline comments, try to write code which is
  self documenting or have a short comment preceding your code.
* Do not use the ';' character to write several statements on one line.
* If in doubt refer to the style guide.
